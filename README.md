# Adventures in Data Science

Welcome to Adventures in Data Science! Here you'll find a collection of smaller, hands-on projects I’ve worked on while learning the core concepts of data science. Each project focuses on different aspects of the field—from data cleaning and exploration to machine learning and visualization. These are a mix of personal challenges, class projects, and experimentation as I hone my skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and other tools. Feel free to explore, contribute, or just see how I’ve approached problem-solving in data science!

Projects:
1. Convolutional Autoencoders and Adversarial Attacks (MNIST Dataset)
